# Weekly Report 01
## What did I do this week?
I used the time I had to research the problem I am interested in and write a project proposal. 
I also started to set up my project locally.

## How has the project progressed?
I created a git repository and decided on the project specifications. 

## What did I learn this week?
I took a deep dive into concepts and implementation details of GANs, which is not as helpful as I thought, because I will go with a smaller scope. 
Then, going with a feedforward neural network, I also refreshed my knowledge on this. I learned about the complexity of neural networks. 

## What has been unclear or problematic?
- I could not enrol in the course at first, so I did not have access to the moodle. This made it hard to get all the information I needed
- After seeing that my project idea would not fit the courses scope I had to redo some of my research

## What are my next steps?
I will decide on the concrete architecture and implement the methods. I will start with the feature engineering and data preprocessing.
