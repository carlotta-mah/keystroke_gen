# Weekly Report 05
My current progress on the UI can be found in the branch `impl-ui`, also see this [pr](https://github.com/carlotta-mah/keystroke_gen/pull/4).


## What did I do this week?
I have implemented keystroke processing with the model.
I have also written the code review for the other students code.

## How has the project progressed?
- I can read and process the keystroke data with the model
- I have feature engineering and encoding for the data

## What did I learn this week?
np matmul can overflow.

## What has been unclear or problematic?
- Finding and fixing bugs, especially with matrix multiplication -> I spent a lot of time wondering why I get nan values, trying to debug the math

## What are my next steps?
- User Interface
- save trained model
