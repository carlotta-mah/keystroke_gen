# Weekly Report 01
## What did I do this week?
I took time to acquire, inspect and analyze the data. Then I programmed the data preprocessing and feature engineering.
I also took time to implement testing and documentation, as well as an automatic testing pipeline which will run as soon as I merge to main.
## How has the project progressed?
I can now read data (data files not included in git) and preprocess it. 
I started a CI pipeline.

## What did I learn this week?
I read up on feature scaling. Also, I learned about data handling in python. Finally, I set up my first CI pipeline! 

## What has been unclear or problematic?
- Is it OK to use panda?
- I had some bugs that threw me off but I think that is normal

## What are my next steps?
I plan to implement the forward pass of the neural network. If I have the time, I will also implement the backpropagation algorithm next week.
