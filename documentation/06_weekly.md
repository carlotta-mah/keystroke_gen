# Weekly Report 06
## What did I do this week?
I spent an insane amount of time debugging functions that were not broken. 
I wrote the review for another project.

## How has the project progressed?
I wrote a packpropagation test with numbers that I computed. You can also find a similar walkthrough on this website https://theneuralblog.com/forward-pass-backpropagation-example/.
I also made a jubpyter notebook that shows the functioning of the neural netowrk.

## What did I learn this week?
I really got into calculating the backpropagation and forward pass by hand. 

## What has been unclear or problematic?
- I am got myself on a wild goose chase because I mixed up some parameters and was convinced that my algorithms were wrong. I just had a different order of the weights. And then I messed up the shape of the inputs. I rewrote the forward pass and backpropagation functions so many times.
- I spent way too much time debugging this. I just spent way too much time in general.
- I did not have time to implement any fancy UI, and I am not sure if I will have time to do it. 
- The network does calculate things and seems to work fine with dummy data but the predictions for my actual data are not good. I need to figure out why.

## What are my next steps?
I will try to figure out why the predictions are not good. 
I also need to improve the documentation and readme, as mentioned in my (very thorough :)) peer code reviews.
