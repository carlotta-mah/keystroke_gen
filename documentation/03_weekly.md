# Weekly Report 03
My work on this weeks goal is still WIP, to view the progress, please checkout the branch impl_neural_network

## What did I do this week?
I implemented a first version of the neural network from scratch. 

## How has the project progressed?
We have a model class, which has methods for propagation, activation function and derivatives

## What did I learn this week?
I better understand propagation through models now

## What has been unclear or problematic?
- Finding and fixing bugs related to matrix shapes especially

## What are my next steps?
- Next week: Finish functionality of neural network. Then process keystroke data with it.
- Later: more efficient calculations, User Interface

## Weekly hours
* Implementation: 15h
* Writing: 2h
